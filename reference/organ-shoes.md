# Organ Shoes
If you find yourself liking the pipe organ and want to seriously get into it after this class, you'll want to pick up a pair of organ shoes at one point or another.

For more information on what makes up an "organ shoe," and to learn if you could use or adapt an existing pair, visit the BYU Organ Program's "[Organ Shoes](http://www.organ.byu.edu/ORSHOE.html)" page.
