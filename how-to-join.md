# How do I join?
Class starts **October 18** and is held every Sunday, from 2pm to 2:45pm Mountain Time.

The simplest way to join the class is to send an email to Elder J.P. Cranford. Ask whoever pointed you here for his email address. (I'd love to put it up on the internet for all to see, but I'm told that's a bad ideaâ„¢)
