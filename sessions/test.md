## Guidelines
This class is designed to introduce you to the pipe organ, so you can more confidently lead congregation in worship.

I’ll be teaching from the instrument as much as possible, and in the vein of a certain [painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross), I invite you to sit at a piano or organ and follow along as appropriate.

* **Question:** What do you want to get out of this class?

Last year’s workshop had a few issues:
	- Too in-depth
	- Not structured/organized well
	- Lack of student playing
	- Not immediately applicable
	- Participants would often say something like "This is really nice, but I just don't have that kind of time to commit to practicing/re-learning all the hymns"

Topics have been ordered in importance from “You’ve just been asked to play this thing in an hour, what do you need to know?” to “I’ve been called and have to play in a few weeks.” Anything needing more time to learn than a few weeks will be covered in the last section.

## Class Structure
	1. Theoretical (30 min.)
	2. Practical (30 min.)
