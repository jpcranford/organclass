# Preludes and Postludes

> 19.4.3.1
> Prelude and Postlude Music
> Quiet prelude and postlude music creates an atmosphere of worship that invites the Spirit into Church meetings. The organist or pianist usually plays hymns or other appropriate music for 5â€“10 minutes before and after a meeting. Playing hymns can help members review gospel teachings in their minds.
