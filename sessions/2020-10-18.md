# Welcome!
This class is being held to introduce pianists to the organ, and to improve a beginner organist's skills, in roughly that order. Topics have been arranged in the order of "I've been asked to play in 15 minutes, how do I turn this thing on??" to "The Bishopric have discovered I play the piano, and have asked me start playing in sacrament meeting in a few weeks." The first few sessions will therefore be fairly basic &mdash; how to turn on the organ, how to get sound out of it, etc. &mdash; and then we'll cover some more organ-specific skills before wrapping up.[^3]

> “One of the great musical misunderstandings in church music is this: if you can play the piano, you can play the organ. This misconception produces terror in pianists as they approach the organ, and results in organists who lack the confidence to provide musical and spiritual leadership in the service. There is no substitute for the kind of training that provides confidence in the organist, and that *improves the spiritual effectiveness* of music in the sacrament meeting.”

I’ll be teaching from the instrument as much as possible, so in the vein of a certain [painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross), I invite you to sit down at your keyboard &mdash; be it piano, organ, synthesizer, or anything in between &mdash; and follow along with us where appropriate.

<p style="display:none;">
  **Introductions.** Let's go around the Zoom call and introduce ourselves. Who are you? How long have you been playing the organ? What do you want to get out of this class?
</p>

## What You'll Need
For this virtual class, I recommend:
- something to take notes&ndash; a notepad and writing stick, tablet, laptop, whatever works for you
- a practice keyboard of some sort
- Our class website: [https://jpcranford.github.io/organclass/](https://jpcranford.github.io/organclass/)
- The [Zoom app]() for our weekly classes.

```note
### Organ Shoes
If you find yourself liking the pipe organ and want to seriously get into it after this class, you'll want to pick up a pair of organ shoes at one point or another.

Essentially, a pair of "organ shoes" is any shoe that fits well, has a non-grip sole (e.g. leather or suede), and a 1" to 1¼" heel. The heel is especially important, as it will make pressing pedals with your heels much easier, and allow you greater reach between your heel and toe. Dance shoes frequently fall under this description.

***Adapting an existing pair.*** If you already have a pair of shoes that fit the above description but have the wrong kind of sole, it's possible you could get them re-soled at a cobbler.

***Purchasing a new pair.*** If you decide to buy a new pair, [Organ Master Shoes](http://www.organmastershoes.com) is a great company where you can get a pair that will not only last you years, but also have a few more features that make them especially suited for organists.

## Format of Each Class
30 min. - Tutorial

15 min. - Q&A (any topic)

## First Look: The Console
It's important that the first thing to remember is **don't panic**. Most of your skills are transferable, and with a basic knowledge of how the console works, you can be up and running in no time.

* Console Layout
  * Every real pipe organ is unique, like a fingerprint, but there are certain guidelines that they all follow in construction.
  - Digital organs are built to work like "real" pipe organs, so I'll describe how a real pipe organ works.
* how to sit at the bench
  - ear care
    - esp. important as the organ doesn't have decay- keys sound at same volume they start at, all the time.
    - don't continue if your ear starts hurting - even if it's not so much *pain* you feel as it feels like someone is lightly pressing into your ear at certain points
  - stretches for fingers/arms?[^2]
* How to: Manuals
* How to Get Sound: Stops
  * Stop knobs, tabs
  * Stops vs. ranks vs. pipes
    - Our terminology, for our purposes
    - Pipe = actual pipe-that-makes-sound thing
    - Rank = Box of pipes that make the same kind of sound, at different pitches
    - Stop = the kind you pull/push/switch/light up to "turn on" a rank
  * Pitch lengths
    - "Right now, what you'll need is a 8', a 4', and if it's a happy/jubilant hymn, a 2'. We'll go over what those mean in another class, but for now, that's good enough."[^1]

  - Pipe families and their basic effect
    - more detail in later classes
    - Principals = "Basic" Organ Sound
    - Flutes
    - Reeds
    - Strings
    - Hybrids: some ranks sound like they could be in multipel families. 
    - Don't know or can't tell what family a pipe belnogs to? check out [organ stop encyclopedia]() but *trust your own ears*&ndash; not all pipes (or their digital, synthesized equivalent) have a standardized "sound." A Principal 8' on one organ can sound very different than a Principal 8' on another, or even just different enough to change how it blends with other ranks.
- Actually playing the thing
  - Most organ keys have no weight or nearly no weight. Some of them have an initial "stick" at the beginning in imitation of tracker action organs.
  - Once pressed, the key will continue playing, at the same volume, until you let go.
    - If you sound "choppy," you're playing it like a piano. Practice playing the hymn without using the damper pedal. We'll go over more ways to mitigate this effect in a later class.[^4]

[^1]: Review PDFs for beginner organists from BYU (with the black box header at top); those go over this part.
[^2]: Research this or remove.
[^3]: Scour PDFs and handouts for more info on organ shoes
[^4]: Offer some tips to mitigate this, and state that in later sessions, we'll go over how to eliminate it entirely (which is basically by re-learning the hymn from the ground up)

"More detail on each of these in later sessions, bare necessities of sound today"

for pre- (or post) session reading for the class we cover registrations:
- watch one of the Tab Choir's Piping Up broadcasts for interesting registrations
  - use the Oct. 5 broadcast for an excellent demonstration of what a mutation does

- go over plain lengths (8,4,2,16,32) in basic class and include that diagram, go over mutations and mixtures at a later class, and include that diagram then
- **Compile all information, sorted by topic, in an Appendix page**
