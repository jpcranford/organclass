# Welcome!
This class is designed to introduce you to the pipe organ, so you can more confidently lead congregation in worship.

I’ll be teaching from the instrument as much as possible, so in the vein of a certain [painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross), I invite you to sit down at your keyboard &mdash; be it piano, organ, synthesizer, or anything in between &mdash; and follow along with us.

## What You'll Need
For this virtual class, I recommend:
- a notepad and writing stick (a tablet and stylus works fine too)
- a piano for practice
- Internet access for our class website: [https://jpcranford.github.io/organclass/](https://jpcranford.github.io/organclass/)

```note
### Organ Shoes
If you find yourself liking the pipe organ and want to seriously get into it after this class, you'll want to pick up a pair of organ shoes at one point or another.

Essentially, a pair of "organ shoes" is any shoe that fits well, has a non-grip sole (e.g. leather or suede), and a 1" to 1¼" heel. The heel is especially important, as it will make pressing pedals with your heels much easier, and allow you greater reach between your heel and toe. Dance shoes frequently fall under this description.

***Adapting an existing pair.*** If you already have a pair of shoes that fit the above description but have the wrong kind of sole, it's possible you could get them re-soled at a cobbler.

***Purchasing a new pair.*** If you decide to buy a new pair, [Organ Master Shoes](http://www.organmastershoes.com) is a great company where you can get a pair that will not only last you years, but also have a few more features that make them especially suited for organists.

## Purpose of this Workshop
> “One of the great musical misunderstandings in church music is this: if you can play the piano, you can play the organ. This misconception produces terror in pianists as they approach the organ, and results in organists who lack the confidence to provide musical and spiritual leadership in the service. There is no substitute for the kind of training that provides confidence in the organist, and that *improves the spiritual effectiveness* of music in the sacrament meeting.” &ndash; Dr. Don Cook, head of the Organ Department at BYU

This class is held in order to introduce pianists to the organ, and to improve a beginner organist's skills, in roughly that order. So the first few sessions will be fairly basic &mdash; how to turn on the organ, how to get sound out of it, etc. &mdash; and then we'll briefly cover some organ-specific skills before wrapping up.

It's important to remember the first thing to do is **don't panic**. Most of your skills are transferable, and with a basic knowledge of how the console works, you can be up and running in no time.

* Console Layout
  * Every real pipe organ is unique, like a fingerprint, but there are certain guidelines that they all follow in construction.
  * Digital organs are built to work like “real” pipe organs.
* How to Play: Manuals
* How to Get Sound: Stops
  * Stop knobs, tabs
  * Stops vs. ranks
  * Pitch lengths

"More detail in each of these in later sessions, bare necessities of sound today"
- [ ] be sure to cover: "if choppy, you're playing it like a piano." Offer some tips to mitigate this, and state that in later sessions, we'll go over how to eliminate it entirely (which is basically by re-learning the hymn from the ground up)
