# Introduction
This class is being held to introduce pianists to the organ, and to improve a beginner organist's skills, in roughly that order.

Topics have been arranged roughly in the order of "I've been asked to play in 15 minutes, how do I turn this thing on??" to "The Bishop has discovered I can play the piano, and has asked me to start playing in sacrament meeting in a few weeks." Therefore, the first few sessions will be fairly basic &mdash; how to turn on the organ, how to get sound out of it, etc. &mdash; and then we'll cover some more organ-specific skills before wrapping up.

> “One of the great musical misunderstandings in church music is this: if you can play the piano, you can play the organ. This misconception produces terror in pianists as they approach the organ, and results in organists who lack the confidence to provide musical and spiritual leadership in the service. There is no substitute for the kind of training that provides confidence in the organist, and that *improves the spiritual effectiveness* of music in the sacrament meeting.”
>
> &ndash; Dr. Don Cook, "LDS Organist Training," Organ Studies at BYU ([link](http://organ.byu.edu/lds-organist-training/))

I’ll be teaching from the instrument as much as possible, so in the vein of a certain [painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross), I invite you to sit down at your keyboard &mdash; be it piano, organ, synthesizer, or [anything in between](https://youtu.be/ncY5eo0UiTo) &mdash; and follow along with us where appropriate.

**Introductions.** Let's go around the Zoom call and introduce ourselves.
- Who are you?
- How long have you been playing the organ?
- What do you want to get out of this class?
- Would you rather we go step-by-step like a lesson, or review the general principles and leave you to practice on your own?

## What You'll Need
For this virtual class, I recommend:
- something to take notes&ndash; a notepad and writing stick, tablet, laptop, whatever works for you
- a practice keyboard of some sort
- Our class website: [https://jpcranford.github.io/organclass/](https://jpcranford.github.io/organclass/) (a.k.a. the website you're viewing right now)
- The [Zoom app](https://zoom.us/support/download) for our weekly classes.

### Organ Shoes
If you find yourself liking the pipe organ and want to seriously get into it after this class, you'll want to pick up a pair of organ shoes at one point or another.

For more information on what makes up an "organ shoe," and to see if you could use or adapt an existing pair, visit BYU's [page](http://www.organ.byu.edu/ORSHOE.html) on the subject.
```

## Format of Each Class
1. Tutorial = 30 min.
2. Q&A (any topic) = 15 min.

Total length = 45 min.

## First Look: The Console
It's important that the first thing to remember is **don't panic**. Most of your existing piano skills are transferable, and with a basic knowledge of how the console works, you can be up and running in no time.

```tip
### When in doubt, read the manual!
Copies of the organ manual are usually kept in the organ bench, or otherwise in a place near the organ. For digital organ models commonly found in LDS meetinghouses, you can find PDF versions of their manuals [here](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music/accompanying-others/manuals-for-organs).
  - If you're asking "What does this button do?", the manual is the best place to start.
  - If you're asking "Why should I push this button?", this class will tell you.

An **organ console** is the place where an organist sits to control the organ, which can be somewhere else entirely.

### General Terms
Manual
: A keyboard of the organ, to be played by the hands.

Great
: On a two-manual organ, the lower manual. On an organ with real pipes, the Great is often unenclosed (more on what that means later).

Swell
: On a two-manual organ, the upper manual. Usually enclosed.

### At Your Fingertips
Stops
: These turn on the sounds of the organ. More on these in a bit. ([jump to section](#stops))

Couplers
: used to connect one division to another, usually found on stop tablets above the top manual. Their name tells you their function. The Swell/Great adds all the stops pulled on the Swell to the Great. The Great/Pedal adds all the stops pulled on the Great to the Pedal.

Pistons
: These remember combinations of stops for you. General pistons remember the entire organ, divisional pistons remember one division (manual or pedal).

Cancel button
: Look for the piston, usually at the bottom right, with the 0. This cancels your registration. Use in between hymns so no one hears when you accidentally step on a pedal. And at other times.

### At Your Feet
Pedalboard
: The keyboard for your feet. Do not worry, playing with your feet is much easier than it looks.

Toe Studs
: These are the round things at your feet, often duplicating pistons from the manuals. They aren't on every organ, but they can be useful when your hands are busy.

Expression pedals
: These look like large gas pedals. On a large organ, there can be more than one, which can make it difficult to figure out what they do. These are used to "swell" the volume of the organ, or maybe just one division.
: If only one is present, it is usually a pedal to control the volume of the entire organ.
: If two or more are present, the leftmost one will usually correspond to the lowest manual, the next pedal to the manual above that, and so on.

Crescendo pedal
: If present, it is usually the rightmost "expression pedal." It's not really an expression pedal, however, even though it looks like one. This will gradually pull out the stops of the organ until what we call "full organ" is reached. Best used sparingly, as the fade is not always smooth.

## Finding the On Switch
Short answer: Good luck. This is one of the areas where the phrase "every organ is unique" rears its head. Be sure to [read the manual](#when-in-doubt-read-the-manual).

The on switch is *usually* located to the left or right of the keyboard. The Salt Lake Tabernacle Organ's is in a drawer located underneath the left stop jam.

If you have real pipes, ensure the blowers are turned on too- they may or may not have a separate switch, and it could be located on the console, or in a different room altogether.

## Stops
Stops activate the sounds of the organ. Your organ may have stop tabs, knobs, rocker switches, or some other kind. "Pull out" the stop (press it, toggle it, flip it) to open it up to air, and play it.

### Stop Families
There are four families of pipe organ ranks:

1. Principals
2. Flutes
3. Strings

4. Reeds

We'll go over this in more detail later, but to quickly find out which one a given pipe is, check out this [handy PDF]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/NewWardOrganist-Common_Stop_Names.pdf) from BYU's *New Ward Organist* program.

### Pitch lengths
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pitch1.gif" style="float:right;width:25%;max-width:175px;filter:grayscale(100%) contrast(200%);">

One of the signature "sounds" of the organ is the ability to play multiple octaves with each key. To accomplish this, the stops are labeled according to a standardized system:
- 8' = sounds at written pitch
- 4' = one octave above written pitch
- 2' = two octaves above written pitch

And likewise, in the other direction:
- 16' = one octave below written pitch
- 32' = two octaves below written pitch

## The Keys
Most organ keys have no weight or nearly no weight. Some of them have an initial "stick" at the beginning in imitation of tracker action organs.

Once pressed, the key will continue playing, at the same volume, until you let go. If you sound "choppy," you're playing it like a piano. Practice playing the hymn without using the damper pedal. We'll go over some special techniques to help mitigate this effect in a later class.

## Putting It All Together
Alright, back to the (hopefully) metaphorical scenario where you have 15 minutes to prepare a registration for a hymn. Assuming you don't want to, or can't, play the pedals yet, Here's what you do:

1. Pick a hymn that you can play in a legato style.
   - To make this easier for beginning organists, the LDS Church has put together a book specifically for this purpose: *Manual-Only Hymns for Organ* ([PDF](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/english/pdf/callings/music/manualonly-100602.pdf?lang=eng)). This book even has a primer in its appendix covering a few of the organ-specific techniques to use.
2. Right now, what you'll need is a 8', a 4', and if it's a happy/jubilant hymn, a 2' and/or mixture. We'll go over what those mean in next week's class, but for now, that's good enough."

### Additional Resources
Many of the materials and information covered in this workshop are sourced from these sites.

1. [*The New Ward Organist*](http://organ.byu.edu/the-new-ward-organist/) is a free self-guided program offered by BYU. It includes audio lessons that cover many aspects of the organ program.
  - They also have a [PDF](http://organ.byu.edu/trainingresources.pdf) available for download full of online materials and resources for new organists.
2. "[A Young Person’s Guide to the Pipe Organ](https://www.agohq.org/young-persons-guide/)" is an online article put together by the American Guild of Organists explaining the history of the organ and a bit about how it works.
3. The AGO's online [Glossary of Terms](https://www.agohq.org/young-persons-guide-glossary-of-terms/) provides definitions for many of the words you'll see on a typical console.
4. The [Encyclopedia of Organ Stops](https://organstops.com) is an invaluable resource, collating information from many books dedicated to cataloguing all the different organ pipes in use today.
