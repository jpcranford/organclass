# Welcome!
This class is designed to introduce you to the pipe organ, so you can more confidently lead congregation in worship.

Iâ€™ll be teaching from the instrument as much as possible, and in the vein of a certain [painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross), I invite you to sit at a piano or organ and follow along as appropriate.

**Question for class:** What do you want to get out of this class?
