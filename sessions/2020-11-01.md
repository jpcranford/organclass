# Hymn-Leading

> Pianists who are asked to play the organ for LDS services oftentimes find themselves quite uncomfortable, not knowing how best to proceed in order to play a credible service while developing their organ skills. This might be the result of various factors:
> 1. They may have limited keyboard facility and find playing four-voice hymns a challenge.
> 2. They often do not understand how piano and organ techniques differ. The absence of a sustaining pedal on the organ creates challenges in legato playing. When playing hymns, pianists tend to think vertically (a succession of chords connected by the sustaining pedal) rather than horizontally (multiple independent legato lines sounding simultaneously).
> 3. They have limited understanding of the function of the organ’s various mechanical and tonal resources (stops).
> 4. They are intimidated, thinking that they must try to use the pedals immediately.
> The piano and organ are two very different instruments, and it is a fallacy to assume that because one can play the piano, he or she can also play the organ competently without further instruction.
> In an attempt to assist inexperienced organists, an edition of selected LDS hymns entitled *Manual-Only Hymns for Organ* has been prepared that reduces the number of voices from four to three. The hymns also have been carefully edited with fingerings appropriate to the organ. Material in the book’s preface and appendix explains and illustrates various organ techniques, particularly with regard to fingering and linear thinking. Assimilation of and adherence to these concepts and techniques will result in confident hymn playing.

## Registering a Hymn
```warning
Do not use celestes on a hymn! Confuses congregation re: pitch.

Do not use tremulants on a hymn! Confuses congregation re: rhythm.

- Open a hymnal, show differences- *not* written for piano or organ, but for four-part vox
