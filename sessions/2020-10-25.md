## Divisions of the Organ
- Manuals vs. Divisions
  - https://organtutor.byu.edu/content/two-manual-organ-console
  - Enclosed vs. Encased vs. Exposed (diagram: https://organtutor.byu.edu/sites/default/files/manual2.svg)

## Stops
- Stops vs. ranks vs. pipes
- Pipe = actual pipe-that-makes-sound thing
    - Rank = Box of pipes that make the same kind of sound, at different pitches
    - Stop = the kind you pull/push/switch/light up to "turn on" a rank
  - Stops are associated with a division

## Pipe lengths
- go over plain lengths (8,4,2,16,32) in basic class and include that diagram, go over mutations and mixtures at a later class, and include that diagram then

## Stop Families
- Principals = "Basic" Organ Sound:tm:
- Flutes = soft; clear tone
- Reeds = brassy, "spicy," trumpet-like
- Strings = sweet, mushy
- Hybrids: some ranks sound like they could be in multiple families.
- Not sure what family an unfamiliar pipe belongs to? Check out the [Encyclopedia of Organ Stops](https://organstops.com) but *trust your own ears*&ndash; not all pipes (or their digital, synthesized equivalent) have a standardized "sound." A Principal 8' on one organ can sound very different than a Principal 8' on another, or even just different enough to change how it blends with other ranks.
