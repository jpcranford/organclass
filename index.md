> *Lose no opportunity of practicing on the organ; there is no other instrument which takes a swifter revenge on anything unclear or sloppy in composition or playing.* - Robert Schumann

This class is designed to introduce you to the pipe organ, so you can more confidently lead congregation in worship. This site is where I'll post everything you'll need for our sessions, both before and after, as well my personal notes from each class.

Iâ€™ll be teaching from the instrument as much as possible, so in the vein of a certain [painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross), I invite you to sit at a piano or organ and follow along as appropriate.
