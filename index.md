# Welcome!
This is the site where I'll post all the pre-readings for the classes the week before the video call, and following the class, *everything* we discussed: my teaching outline, post-readings and practice suggestions, any notes I took, etc.

### Problems with Last Year's Class
- Too in-depth
- Not structured/organized well
- Lack of student playing
- Not immediately applicable
- Participants would often say something like "This is really nice, but I just don't have that kind of time to commit to practicing/re-learning all the hymns"
