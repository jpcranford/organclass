# Teaching Outline: October 18
- "This is a keyboard"
- how to sit at organ bench


### Problems with Last Year's Class
- Too in-depth
- Not structured/organized well
- Lack of student playing
- Not immediately applicable
- Participants would often say something like "This is really nice, but I just don't have that kind of time to commit to practicing/re-learning all the hymns"
